# Face Swapping algorithm

Implemented a face swapping algorithm that searches and selects faces within an
image and replaces them with another face with realistic results.
It identifies and uses the most suitable faces using a
selection process, face extraction using optimal seam search, and
blending using linear RGB channel scaling and Poisson Blending.
